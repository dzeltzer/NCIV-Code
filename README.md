This repo contains the replication code for Itai Walk's thesis - "Falsification Tests of Instrumental Variables Using Negative Control Outcomes". For the repo that corresponds to the academic paper: "Negative Control Falsification Tests for Instrumental Variable Designs" see https://github.com/barwein/NC_for_IV. Main differences: The paper includes also the use of NCE for falsicication tests, and the simulations are done differntly, with different scenarions (with controls), and using GAM instead of SUR and permutations tests based on Random Forest and Bagging.
